# Responsive Navbar

This is an example of a responsive navbar created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Explanation

The responsive navbar is a common user interface element in web design. It provides a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate between pages on a website. The navbar is usually placed at the top of the page, and it typically includes a logo or website name, links to various pages or sections of the website, and sometimes additional functionality such as search or user account options.

This responsive navbar is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. It is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML code defines the structure of the navbar, including the logo, navigation menu, and toggle button for smaller screens. The CSS code styles the navbar with colors, fonts, and spacing. The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the toggle button, which displays and hides the navigation menu on smaller screens.
